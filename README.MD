## My Role

An AI Developer specializing in AI chatbot development, AI integration, and automation, focusing on CRM automation to streamline real estate lead generation processes and improve operational scalability.

## Project Description

### Objective

To optimize and scale a real estate lead generation system by enhancing an existing workflow built on Make.com and Vapi.ai platforms. The goal is to improve system efficiency, handle higher call volumes, automate lead capture, and integrate smart scheduling.

### Key Needs
Concurrent Call Handling: Enable processing of 3–5 simultaneous calls, supporting a daily volume of 150–200 inbound calls through Make.com coupled with Vapi.ai intelligent call processing.

Smart Booking System: Integrate Google Calendar API to perform automatic schedule conflict detection and resolution for real estate appointment bookings.

Automated Lead Capture & Communication: Implement auto-answer functionality for inbound calls with AI-driven data capture (collecting caller's name, phone number, property address, and interest details) and seamless forwarding of captured data via email and SMS notifications for timely CRM updates.

### Required Expertise & Skills

Proven experience with Make.com for workflow automation and scenario optimization.

Deep knowledge of Vapi.ai API and telephony automation for AI-powered call handling.

Competency in Google Calendar API integration and smart scheduling algorithms.

Ability to design scalable, fault-tolerant workflows to support growing call volumes.

Prior experience in real estate automation is highly preferred, knowing industry-specific lead qualification criteria and CRM processes.

### Competitive and Industry Context
Current real estate lead generation systems increasingly rely on integrated AI and automation to improve lead qualification speed and booking efficiency. Platforms like Make.com and Vapi.ai enable flexible, custom workflows but require expert optimization for higher volumes.

The market demands solutions that can scale call handling without loss of personalization, harness AI for natural conversations, and seamlessly sync with calendar and CRM systems to reduce manual workload. Automated workflows become critical differentiators for real estate agencies competing on speed and responsiveness.
